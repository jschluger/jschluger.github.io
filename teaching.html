  <h1>Teaching</h1>
  <p>
    I've always found that I only fully understand a topic once I've tried to explain it to someone else. I love sharing knowledge with others, and helping students get and stay excited about learning. I am avaliable for private tutoring sessions, specilizing in computer science, math, and other S.T.E.M. subjects. Please <a href="mailto:jeschluger@gmail.com?subject=Tutoring Inquiry">get in contact via email</a> for all tutoring inquiries! <b>I currently have availability for new students.</b>
