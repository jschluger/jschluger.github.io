  <h1>Teaching Background</h1>
  <p>
    I've always found that I only fully understand a topic once I've tried to
    explain it to someone else. I love sharing knowledge with others, and helping
    students get and stay excited about learning. I have experience teaching
    students at all levels, from 7 years old up to college students. I've worked in
    one-on-one tutoring settings to support students in their classes, or with a
    personally designed curiculium for extracuricular learning. I've also worked
    as a Teaching Assistant at Cornell University for both introductary and
    graduate level Computer Science classes.
