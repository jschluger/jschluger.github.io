  <h1>Professional</h1>
  <p>
    I currently work at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia as a Data Scientist in the
    Data Science and Biostatistics Unit.

    I graduated from Cornell University summa cum laude with a Bachlor of Arts
    in Computer Science, in May 2021. I am very interested in studying the ways
    algorithms and automation impact people, our society, and our world, and how
    technology can be used to address the problems we face.
