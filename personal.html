  <h1>Personal</h1>
  <p>
    I can be very silly, or serious. I like to take in the world and lift up the voices of those around me. I will tell you what's on my mind if it's on something that I think I know what I'm talking about, and I try not to talk above others on things I don't have experience with.

    One thing I like to do for fun is to skateboard. The last trick I learned was a 50-50 grind on a ledge; two tricks I want to learn next are a 50-50 grind on a rail and a frontside flip. I am scared I'll try to skate again when spring comes and I won't be able to kickflip anymore, but we'll just have to wait and see.

    I like to read books, graphic novels, manga, the newspaper, ants (<a href="https://mayacmatunis.wordpress.com/earlydays/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/ant.png" style="height: 15pt"</img></a>),
