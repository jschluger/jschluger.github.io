  <h1>Personal</h1>
  <p>
    I can be very silly, or serious. I like to take in the world and lift up
    the voices of those around me. I will tell you what's on my mind if it's on
    something I have experience with, and I try not to talk over others on
    things I don't have experience with. I was born and raised in New York
    City, and now I live in Philadelphia.

    For fun I like to skate and bike around the city. The next skateboard trick
    I want to learn is a frontside boardslide. I like to play guitar and
    sing too. I've been having fun learning some Heartless Bastards songs recently;
    Erika Wennerstrom's voice (their lead singer) is so beautiful.

    I like to read books, graphic novels, manga, the newspaper, ants (<a
