<b>Subject</b>: (Negative) Feedback on Your Plan for Greek Life<br>
<b>Sent</b>: Thursday December 18, 2019 12:21 p.m.<br>
<br>
Martha Pollack,<br><br>
The plan you released this morning to address Greek Life in all its problems is terrible, and here’s why:
<br> <br>First, a bit about me: I am a junior here at Cornell. I was in Greek life from my freshman spring until this semester, and now I no longer am.
<br> <br>Back to how bad your plan is: first, this bullet point:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Calibri, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">
  <li>Greek-letter chapters that host events on or off campus in chapter houses, annexes or third-party venues will be required to retain independent event monitors for all events; and for large events, they must retain third-party vendors for both alcohol service and security.</li>
</ul>All you are doing here is insisting that only fraternities with sufficient funds can host parties. Do you really think that a private security force and independent monitors will make party goers significantly safer, because I don’t. These security forces likely stay in the main party areas during events, doing nothing to combat assault which is probable to happen in many places outside of these main areas. While this point may have some positive affects on saftey and limiting underage drinking, in reality the main effect is that greek organizations which can afford these services—or maybe even afford services that will turn a blind eye to underage drinking—will continue there same behaviors, while the rest of the greek community will be limited and forced to actually follow these policies and possibly limit the number of events they can have.
<br> <br>In summary, you are empowering the richest groups on campus to continue their bad behavior while (rightfully) limiting the expression of the rest of the greek organizations.
<br> <br>Next:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Calibri, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">
  <li>A university-staffed, roving security team will be deployed nightly to undertake random spot-checks of on- and off-campus properties for potential violations of event management policies or the law. Any indication of misbehavior will result in immediate notification of appropriate law enforcement agencies with a request that noncompliant events be shut down.</li>
</ul>In my understanding, you do not know which off-campus properties are inhabited by greek life members. So, this point authorizes the creation of a new security force to patrol all off-campus student housing for potential law breaking? Do you realize how sweeping this change is to the campus culture and potential for communities to form?
<br> <br>I feel extremely unsafe at the prospect of more Cornell security forces patrolling the off campus neighborhood where I live, every night. The numerous stories I have heard from friends of CUPD officers harassing them on campus now will likely become a reality off campus as well. (#ACAB)
<br> <br>Further, there is no way for a private off-campus residence to avoid getting investigated by this security force under your policy for having loud parties because they do not have the same channels for registering events as fraternities still do under your plan. So, you are doing the most to limit the types of events and gatherings the rest of the Cornell community can hold, while providing additional resources to greek organizations to help them comply with these new rules, maintain their elevated status in the eyes of the Cornell administration and domination over most of the party scene at Cornell.
<br> <br>This policy harms everyone in our community, but especially people of color and queer and trans people who are most likely to have a traumatic or dangerous interaction with the police; notably, these communities are already largely excluded from greek life. This policy limits the freedom to gather and the freedom of expression of these already marginalized groups who deserve the right to have parties from time to time without being monitored by a dedicated campus security force. If you want to shift the culture of Cornell’s campus, you should elevate new voices and new communities in place of greek life, rather than dampening the freedom of expression of the entire campus via increased surveillance extending to our private residences.
<br> <br>
<br> <br>If the only way you see to fix greek life has the side affect of being classist within the greek system, and more importantly requires surveilling the entire Cornell community off-campus, then I can think of a much better solution: getting rid of greek life all together. Try harder.

nvestigation, Cornell University Police, working with state and local law enforcement and the Tompkins County district attorney, have not yet been able to determine what happened to Antonio between the time he was last seen at the party and when his body was discovered. We remain in close contact with Antonio’s parents, and they deserve the closure of knowing what happened to their son. I implore anyone with information to please contact the police at<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>

<br>
<br>As I noted in my<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
<a data-cke-saved-href="https://statements.cornell.edu/2019/20191119-president-offers-update.cfm" href="http://t01.list.cornell.edu/t/2925802/54882112/1204042/1044/" style="color: rgb(0, 102, 153); font-weight: inherit; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: left; line-height: 27px; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Calibri, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; text-decoration: underline;">November 19 community message</a>, the unregistered fraternity party, during which freshmen were served alcohol and participated in drinking games, violated a number of Cornell’s Greek life policies. I find it particularly disturbing that Phi Kappa Psi had just attended a judicial hearing the day before for additional misconduct. The chapter has been placed on interim suspension pending a full review by the Greek judicial system.
<br>
<br>Regrettably, this is not an isolated incident. We have on this campus, as do many of our peers on their campuses, a persistent culture of misconduct in the Greek-letter system; a pattern that dates back years, if not decades, and one that I have witnessed during my two-and-a-half years as Cornell’s president. Indeed, a series of troubling hazing episodes in the winter of 2018 led to my announcing a set of new Greek policies in May of that year. At that time, naysayers told me that the new policies would not have their intended impact of eliminating misconduct. Unfortunately, those naysayers were correct. In the 19 months since those new policies went into effect, fully six Greek organizations have engaged in behavior so problematic as to merit suspension of their recognition by the university. This number does not include the current interim suspension of Phi Kappa Psi.
<br>
<br>It is clear to me and to my leadership team that in order to promote the health and safety of our students we must impose additional – and meaningful – reforms on Greek life at Cornell.
<br>
<br>We have deliberated carefully about a wide variety of options, and in the process have received a great deal of thoughtful input from a variety of stakeholders. We heard from alumni who spoke of their positive Cornell Greek life experiences and who implored us to protect that system, even as we considered meaningful change. We also heard from alumni who had positive Greek life experiences and who implored us to radically alter the system; in some cases, even imploring us to abolish it altogether. We heard from parents, students and faculty who expressed a range of views while noting, with very few exceptions, that<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>something</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>needs to be done. And, we followed closely the decisions made by the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic Council (PHC) to address the situation: first, by putting in place a ban on social activities for the remainder of this semester and swiftly and seriously sanctioning houses that violate the ban; and second, by introducing policies aimed at reducing dangerous behavior. As we considered all of this input, we also studied the experiences of other universities in dealing with similar problems.
<br>
<br>There is no doubt that Greek life plays a valuable role on campus, providing many students with communities that can make our large university feel smaller and more welcoming; serving as a place where lifelong friendships are often formed; and often offering opportunities to learn important leadership skills and to positively contribute to the local community. Yet, while there are things to applaud in Greek life’s contributions, there is also much that is wrong in that system, both at Cornell and nationally. We must find ways to permanently curtail behaviors that are putting the safety of our students at risk – from excessive and harmful drinking and substance abuse; to sexual harassment and assault; to demeaning and extremely troubling hazing activities.
<br>
<br>IFC policy enhancements, such as its decision to ban alcohol at spring rush events, are a start, and Vice President Lombardi and his team will work with fraternity and sorority leadership to refine and expand those policies next semester. But we only have to look at our recent history – from former President Skorton’s 2011 decision to abolish pledging to my above-mentioned 2018 reforms – to see that these additional policies will not, on their own, be sufficient. We need to be clear that policies are to be followed, and, critically, we need to bring about a culture change within Greek life at Cornell to address the root causes of the misconduct<strong>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong>I am therefore announcing today a series of stringent new reforms, driven by my responsibility as Cornell’s president to provide a safe environment for our students.
<br>
<br><strong>Strong Enforcement</strong>
<br>There is no question that we need even more rigorous and timely enforcement of the policies that govern behavior in our Greek-letter houses. Accordingly, effective immediately:

  <li>Should any violations, at events or otherwise, pose health and safety risks (including but not limited to underage alcohol consumption, insufficient event monitoring/controls, or failure to register an on- or off-campus event), the chapter will be immediately placed on interim suspension, with all chapter activities ceased pending the outcome of a Greek judicial proceeding. Should the outcome of that proceeding substantiate the violations, the final sanction will range from a minimum of a three-year suspension to permanent dismissal from university recognition.</li>

Peer pressure that results from feeling that one may be excluded leads to bad and risky behavior choices, which is only heightened during the annual recruitment process; hazing, of course, is a direct result of an “in-group” coercing others who aspire to join that group. It is time to bring our Greek policies in line with<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span>

  <li>Vice President Lombardi and his staff will work with Greek leadership to design an entirely new recruitment process, one that promotes inclusion, reduces competition and advances the positive aspects of the Greek life system. The process will be implemented for the 2020-21 academic year and will include more structured opportunities to meet potential new members during and prior to recruitment, a member selection process that is less exclusionary, as well as a cultural shift that replaces parties with philanthropy and service activities as core process components.</li>
  <li>Effective immediately, all formal and informal recruitment and new member education activities must be entirely substance free, and no recruitment activities can take place after 8 p.m. Failure by any chapter to adhere to these guidelines will result in immediate removal from the recruitment and new member process, with no new class recruited that year.</li>

That is intentional. I also recognize that this cultural shift, so desperately needed, will be difficult to realize. But this shift will help to ensure that our Greek-letter organizations continue to be places where students can form communities of friends, develop leadership skills, and contribute to our campus and local communities in healthy and positive ways. Importantly, once these changes are implemented and embedded in the Greek community, they will be applied to other campus organizations as well.
  <br>
  <br>I look forward to working with all of you on implementing these changes and to creating a different – but stronger and healthier – Greek system for Cornell.
