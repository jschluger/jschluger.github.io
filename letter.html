	<br> <br>First, a bit about me: I am a junior here at Cornell. I was in Greek life from my freshman spring until this semester, and now I no longer am.
	<br> <br>Back to how bad your plan is: first, this bullet point:
	<ul style="margin-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Calibri, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">
	  <li>Greek-letter chapters that host events on or off campus in chapter houses, annexes or third-party venues will be required to retain independent event monitors for all events; and for large events, they must retain third-party vendors for both alcohol service and security.</li>
	</ul>All you are doing here is insisting that only fraternities with sufficient funds can host parties. Do you really think that a private security force and independent monitors will make party goers significantly safer, because I don’t. These security forces likely stay in the main party areas during events, doing nothing to combat assault which is probable to happen in many places outside of these main areas. While this point may have some positive affects on saftey and limiting underage drinking, in reality the main effect is that greek organizations which can afford these services—or maybe even afford services that will turn a blind eye to underage drinking—will continue there same behaviors, while the rest of the greek community will be limited and forced to actually follow these policies and possibly limit the number of events they can have.
	<br> <br>In summary, you are empowering the richest groups on campus to continue their bad behavior while (rightfully) limiting the expression of the rest of the greek organizations.
	<br> <br>Next:
	<ul style="margin-top: 0px; padding-left: 20px; font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, Calibri, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;">
	  <li>A university-staffed, roving security team will be deployed nightly to undertake random spot-checks of on- and off-campus properties for potential violations of event management policies or the law. Any indication of misbehavior will result in immediate notification of appropriate law enforcement agencies with a request that noncompliant events be shut down.</li>
	</ul>In my understanding, you do not know which off-campus properties are inhabited by greek life members. So, this point authorizes the creation of a new security force to patrol all off-campus student housing for potential law breaking? Do you realize how sweeping this change is to the campus culture and potential for communities to form?
	<br> <br>I feel extremely unsafe at the prospect of more Cornell security forces patrolling the off campus neighborhood where I live, every night. The numerous stories I have heard from friends of CUPD officers harassing them on campus now will likely become a reality off campus as well. (#ACAB)
	<br> <br>Further, there is no way for a private off-campus residence to avoid getting investigated by this security force under your policy for having loud parties because they do not have the same channels for registering events as fraternities still do under your plan. So, you are doing the most to limit the types of events and gatherings the rest of the Cornell community can hold, while providing additional resources to greek organizations to help them comply with these new rules, maintain their elevated status in the eyes of the Cornell administration and domination over most of the party scene at Cornell.
	<br> <br>This policy harms everyone in our community, but especially people of color and queer and trans people who are most likely to have a traumatic or dangerous interaction with the police; notably, these communities are already largely excluded from greek life. This policy limits the freedom to gather and the freedom of expression of these already marginalized groups who deserve the right to have parties from time to time without being monitored by a dedicated campus security force. If you want to shift the culture of Cornell’s campus, you should elevate new voices and new communities in place of greek life, rather than dampening the freedom of expression of the entire campus via increased surveillance extending to our private residences.
	<br> <br>
	<br> <br>If the only way you see to fix greek life has the side affect of being classist within the greek system, and more importantly requires surveilling the entire Cornell community off-campus, then I can think of a much better solution: getting rid of greek life all together. Try harder.
